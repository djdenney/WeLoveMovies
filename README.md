This is a project for the Thinkful Software Engineering curriculum.

The purpose of this assignment is to practice integrating remote databases
with the backend of an application using knex for PostgreSQL migrations and seeding.

This project has a pre-built frontend that does not work properly when
deployed because of a connection limit imposed by elephantsql.com.

To test this project fully using its frontend, both this repository
and its frontend counterpart at https://github.com/djdenney/frontend-we-love-movies
need to be deployed locally.
